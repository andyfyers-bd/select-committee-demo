They argue that the PNI framework is designed to manage places with attributes that cannot be replaced or substituted for, and public access areas can often be replaced or substituted. They also note that existing public access is well protected by other legal mechanisms, such as vesting land in the Crown or councils, and there are extensive laws that restrict road stopping. They also point out that many places that legally provide public access are not actually used for that purpose, and including public access in the definition could potentially reduce public access.

The main focus of the report is on the purpose and preliminary matters of the Bill, including the title, commencement date, and the purpose of the Act. 

The main recommendation is to amend clause 3 of the Bill to have a single purpose statement that upholds Te Oranga o te Taiao (the health of the natural environment) and clarifies that use and development should support intergenerational well-being. The purpose should also be simplified by removing certain aspects that are adequately covered in other parts of the Bill. Additionally, the definition of Te Oranga o te Taiao should be moved into clause 3 and augmented to clarify the relationships between the health of the natural environment and the well-being of people and communities. 

The report also recommends adding a further clause to identify the key mechanisms for achieving the purpose of the Bill, such as system outcomes, limits and targets, decision-making principles, and provisions for places of national importance and highly vulnerable biodiversity areas.

The main recommendation is to provide a strong directive and create a firm obligation on decision-makers to implement something by using the term ""give effect."" This term requires careful justification and puts a strong direction on decision-makers. Another recommendation is to have particular regard to certain factors, which means decision-makers should consider them and give them weight. The briefing also suggests that decision-makers can discount factors that are not relevant.

Other recommendations include having regard to or taking into account certain factors, which carry a less strong obligation and allow decision-makers to attribute weight as they see fit.

Upton provides independent advice on the reports and highlights areas where improvements are needed to protect and improve the natural environment. 

The main recommendations from Upton include:

1. The proposal to promulgate the first spatial plans prior to articulation of limits and targets is a serious flaw and should be addressed.
2. Requirements for detail across a region could still risk trade-offs in the spatial plans that put the environment at risk.
3. Narrowing the purpose clause of the Natural and Built Environment Bill is promising, but the actual drafting needs to be considered.
4. Leaving a list of non-prioritized system outcomes in the Bill will invite legal uncertainty and risk compromising the natural environment. If non-environmental outcomes need to be included, they should be promoted in the Spatial Planning Bill.
5. Recommended changes to environmental limits and targets are a mixed bag. Improvements proposed are welcomed, but exemptions to limits and protections for places of national importance and significant biodiversity are too broad. Not setting limits and targets in the first NPF is a serious flaw.
6. There appears to be a gap that would not allow protection of places that are of regional importance but not considered of national importance. This gap should be fixed.
7. Provisions on compliance and enforcement, duties and restrictions, and water conservation orders are generally good and should be supported.
8. Making system review by the PCE mandatory is unnecessary and risks the ability of the PCE to perform its wider statutory duties.

Amenity values are defined as the natural or physical qualities and characteristics of an area that contribute to people's appreciation of its pleasantness, aesthetic coherence, and cultural and recreational attributes. The RMA includes amenity values in its definition of the environment and requires that all persons exercising functions and powers under the Act have particular regard to the maintenance and enhancement of amenity values.

The briefing also mentions a recent case, Wallace v Auckland Council, which involved a judicial review of a decision not to notify a resource consent application for a housing development. The case highlighted the importance of assessing the building intensity, scale, location, form, and appearance of a proposed activity in relation to the neighborhood character and residential amenity of the area. The court emphasized that the effects of building intensity include the effects of the numbers of buildings on site and the activities within those buildings.

Another case, Schofield v Auckland Council, demonstrated the subjective nature of determining amenity values. The case involved an application for resource consent to build a deck on a private dwelling. The assessment of amenity values was described as partly subjective but also needing to be objectively scrutinized. The starting point for assessing amenity values is articulated by those who enjoy them, including their activities and emotions associated with the space.

The main recommendation or takeaway from this briefing is the importance of considering and assessing amenity values in the planning and decision-making processes under the RMA. This includes evaluating the building intensity, scale, location, form, and appearance of proposed activities in relation to the neighborhood character and residential amenity of an area.

The RVA argues that the RMA processes are slow, complex, and uncertain, leading to lengthy consenting processes and regulatory barriers for retirement developments. They emphasize the increasing demand for retirement villages due to the growing aged population and the need for housing that suits their needs. The RVA supports the Natural and Built Environment Bill (NBEB) and the Spatial Planning Bill, particularly the National Planning Framework (NPF) as a comprehensive national policy and rule regime for housing activities, including retirement villages. They also support the focus on achieving positive outcomes, the streamlining of decision-making processes, and the fast-track consenting process for housing. However, the RVA suggests that changes are needed in the Bills to prioritize housing needs, clarify resource consent processes, address environmental limits and cultural protections, and improve public participation in regional spatial strategies. 

Matthew Brown, on behalf of Ryman Healthcare Limited, supports the arguments made by the RVA and emphasizes the delays and uncertainty caused by RMA processes in the retirement housing sector. Ryman, as a leading retirement village operator, constructs a significant number of new dwellings each year and has experienced the lengthy resource consent process. They support the initiatives in the Bills that aim to streamline planning and consenting processes but express concerns about the time and complexity of implementing the new regime. Ryman agrees with the RVA's key outcomes and supports the inclusion of Medium Density Residential Standards (MDRS) in the National Planning Framework.

During the hearing session, the RVA and Ryman provided further insights and responses to questions from the Select Committee. They discussed examples of best practice in consenting and planning processes, the need for clear planning provisions, the importance of engaging with councils and communities to ensure understanding of retirement villages, the role of regional spatial strategies in addressing housing needs for the aging population, and the infrastructure issues that can lead to consent refusals.

Overall, the main argument presented by the RVA and Ryman is that the current RMA processes are inadequate for addressing the housing needs of the aging population and that the Natural and Built Environment Bill and the Spatial Planning Bill provide an opportunity to improve and streamline the regulatory framework for retirement villages.",organisation,"The Retirement Villages Association (RVA) and Ryman Healthcare Limited argue that the current Resource Management Act (RMA) processes are slow and complex, causing delays and uncertainty in the retirement housing sector, and support the Natural and Built Environment Bill and the Spatial Planning Bill as opportunities to improve and streamline the regulatory framework for retirement villages.",0.9600681662559509

The judiciary expresses concern about the lack of consultation with them regarding the implications of the bill for the operation of the Environment Court and other courts. They also highlight the complexity of the bill and the need for analysis of its implications on the workload and resources of the courts. 

The submission addresses specific provisions of the bill, including those related to the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi and the responsibility of iwi and hapū. The judiciary raises concerns about the practicality and implications of applying these provisions to courts, particularly in criminal proceedings. They suggest that these provisions should apply to decision-makers other than courts, or if they are intended to apply to courts, the specific categories of decisions should be identified and discussed with the Chief Judge of the Environment Court. 

The submission also raises concerns about the appointment and functions of serving judges, particularly in relation to boards of inquiry and independent hearing panels. The judiciary suggests that appointments of serving judges to these roles should require the prior agreement of the relevant Head of Bench, and that if significant judicial time will be spent on these panels, the resource implications for the Environment Court should be addressed. 

Regarding appeals, the submission questions the justification for confining appeal rights to questions of law and suggests that appeals to the Supreme Court should not be excluded. They also propose that the restriction on judicial review in the High Court should only apply when there is a right to appeal to the Environment Court on the merits. 

The submission raises concerns about the allocation of jurisdictions between the District Court and Environment Court in relation to enforcement provisions. They suggest that the provisions should be reviewed to reduce uncertainty and complexity, and that all civil remedies should be available in the Environment Court.

They express concerns about the lack of integration, sequencing, and timing between the major reform areas being progressed by the government, including the Future for Local Government and Three Waters reforms. They argue that the lack of integration creates uncertainty and confusion for local government and its stakeholders. 

The Councils specifically raise concerns about the proposed Regional Planning Committees (RPCs), which they believe will diminish local voice and input, as well as impose significant additional costs on ratepayers. They argue that the RPCs will have a lot of power but lack accountability to councils, iwi, hapū, and communities. They also express concerns about the disconnect between responsibility for drafting policy and democratic accountability.

The Councils recommend that the RPCs address these concerns by providing better integration between planning and funding decisions and elevating the role of local and regional councils in the planning and decision-making process. They also suggest that the review of the draft Regional Spatial Strategy should be a mandatory requirement.

The Councils also raise concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the content and purpose of Statements of Community Outcomes (SCOs) and Statements of Regional Environmental Outcomes (SREOs). They argue that these documents should be developed using the Local Government Act process and given increased weight in decision-making.

However, the council raises concerns about the scale and pace of change being driven by the government, particularly in relation to the Three Waters Reform, RMA reform, and Local Government Reform. They argue that there is insufficient time and space to properly consider these reforms and engage with communities. They also express concerns about the poor alignment between the Bills and the Three Waters reform, recommending that the connection between the new resource management system and the delivery of water infrastructure should be a priority.

The council also highlights a disconnect between the proposed planning model and existing institutions and governance arrangements.

However, CIAL raises concerns about the complexity and lengthiness of the new regime and the need for clear direction on delivering, maintaining, and protecting infrastructure. 

CIAL specifically suggests that the outcomes section of the bill should not establish a hierarchy between environmental outcomes and infrastructure outcomes. They argue that the infrastructure outcome should be worded in stronger language and reference both the protection and enablement of infrastructure. CIAL also supports exemptions to strict environmental limits and targets, as long as there is a clear pathway for infrastructure that allows for the management of environmental effects.

In terms of designations, CIAL supports the establishment of a high-level framework for infrastructure in the National Policy Framework (NPF) and the designation process focusing on how infrastructure is built and managed. However, they express concerns about the lack of clarity in the designation process and the need for greater legislative direction for each step. They also suggest that the notification provisions for designations need improvement to streamline the process.

CIAL emphasizes the need for clarified and expanded transitional provisions to provide certainty for investment and long-term planning. They specifically seek clarity on the roll-over of existing RMA tools, the status of applications for resource consent and designations, and plan changes that are part-way through the RMA process.

CIAL also highlights the importance of building resilience to climate change effects and transitioning to low-carbon aviation. They suggest that consenting and designating processes to build climate resilience should be facilitated under the new regime.

The submission suggests that more of the matters for which regional councils are responsible should be included as mandatory requirements in NBE plans.

3. Consents with grouped expiry dates: The submission raises concerns about the provision in the NBE Bill that allows for consents to have the same expiry date in specified circumstances. It cites the negative consequences experienced in Otago when Deemed Permits expired and argues that common expiry dates should not be the first option. The submission recommends that the committee consider whether this provision is necessary given the alternative allocation methodologies available in the NBE Bill and the significant resource burden it places on all parties involved in the consenting process.

4. Regional Planning Committees: The submission expresses concerns about the implementation of Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) and the ability to sufficiently resource them. It highlights the challenge of finding skilled secretariats and the potential for resourcing shortages if all councils need to conduct hearings at the same time. The submission suggests that the roll-out of the NBE Act should be staggered and the learnings from the initial implementation should be carefully reviewed to address resourcing shortages.

The submission also notes support for the Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS) and the potential for them to address important regional and local issues. However, it suggests that the statement instruments should be better focused to capture important outcomes and that hearings should be mandatory to ensure community engagement.",organisation,"The submission argues against the NBE and SP Bills, expressing concerns about the Freshwater Working Group, the disconnect between the NBE Bill and the NPSFM, consents with grouped expiry dates, and the implementation of Regional Planning Committees, while also noting support for Regional Spatial Strategies.",0.996707022190094

Firstly, it criticizes the spatial planning aspect of the bill, stating that spatial plans will be made without considering limits and targets, leading to poor planning outcomes. It suggests that spatial plans should be prepared alongside NBA plans to avoid inefficient and bad environmental outcomes.

Secondly, the submission raises concerns about the protection of places of national importance, including significant biodiversity areas. It opposes the ability to obtain exemptions from the effects management hierarchy and calls for a stronger effects management framework and amendment of the offsetting and redress principles.

Thirdly, the submission argues that the limits and targets framework needs significant improvement and should require continuous environmental improvement. It opposes the proposed exemptions and the suggestion of offsetting and redress to meet limits.

They provide five reasons for including it, including the fact that it is part of the RMA provisions and that many people consider spirituality an important part of their relationship with the environment. They also argue that Maori concepts of spiritual environmental values should be recognized and that considering spiritual values is important for a better society.

SOS also argues for the protection of spiritual environmental values to be included in the wider bill, not just limited to water conservation orders. They believe that non-Maori spiritual relationships with the natural world should be recognized and protected.

Their third submission is about the deletion of the reference to intrinsic values of nature and ecosystems in the bill. They argue that intrinsic values should be included to make decision-makers consider the interests of the environment itself, not just the uses humans put it to. They provide examples of cases where the existing listed matters to consider did not cover everything the Environment Court thought was important, and reference to intrinsic value was important and helpful.

Finally, SOS argues for additional improvements to the operation of Water Conservation Orders. They endorse suggestions made by EDS, including plans giving effect to WCOs and reviewing consent conditions. They also argue that the provisions on WCOs need amending to address arguments made in legal proceedings that the words in the bill only allow for the maintenance of a current state, not improvement.

It recommends that the primary and overarching purpose of the Bill should be te Oranga o Te Taiao, which takes priority over other objectives. It also suggests further definition of what ""recognising and upholding"" te Oranga o Te Taiao requires, as well as establishing a hierarchy of outcomes to avoid uncertainty and trade-offs.

They believe that these bills provide an opportunity to transform our way of life from one that disrupts ecosystems to one that regenerates them. The submitter agrees with the objective of protecting and restoring the natural environment for the well-being of present and future generations. They also support the shift in focus from managing adverse effects to promoting positive outcomes.

The submitter argues that in order to achieve these objectives and outcomes, the bills need to prioritize them over development. They believe that the way our civilization has developed has disrupted ecosystems and caused the looming collapse of our ecosystems and economy. The submitter emphasizes the need to change from practices that degrade the environment to practices that regenerate it.

The submitter identifies the underlying causes of ecosystem disruption as the over-exploitation of limited physical resources and the disruption of symbiotic interactions in healthy ecosystems. They also highlight the use of cheap energy from fossil fuels, which has enabled the scale and speed of this disruption.

The submitter proposes solutions to address these issues, including the regeneration of ecosystems to a healthy state and the transformation of our technical/industrial system to use only sustainable energy and resources. They argue that regenerating ecosystems can have rapid and significant benefits, such as increasing soil fertility and preventing erosion. They suggest that enabling rapid change to regenerative practices can buy time while we transform our technical/industrial system.

The submitter acknowledges the challenges in transforming the built environment to a less energy-intensive and environmentally benign state. They suggest that changes need to be coordinated and reinforce each other to be effective and less disruptive. They also emphasize the need to prioritize ecological/environmental benefits over monetary benefits in decision-making.

They advocate for healthy environments that prioritize the wellbeing of all individuals, including women, children, Māori, diverse communities, and those with disabilities. The NCWNZ supports the Purpose of the Act and the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.

The NCWNZ argues that the definition of the environment in the bill does not adequately consider the wellbeing of the natural and built environments and their communities. They believe that ecological integrity, mana, and mauri should be central to support healthy outcomes, including human health and wellbeing. They also recommend the inclusion of amenity values to contribute to people's appreciation of the environment.

Regarding climate change, the NCWNZ suggests that the Act should be strengthened to build resilience and mitigate its effects. They emphasize the importance of protecting resources such as air, water, and biodiversity and managing land activity to address the climate crisis. They also highlight the need for low carbon infrastructure and urban planning that considers climatic circumstances.

The NCWNZ raises concerns about the National Planning Framework (NPF), arguing that it should integrate human and environmental health and wellbeing. They believe that the centralization of power in government and standardized decision-making processes may hinder community engagement and reduce equality, particularly for women.

The NCWNZ criticizes an extraordinary clause in the Act that prohibits considering adverse effects on low-income individuals when assessing applications. They argue that this clause is regressive, discriminatory, and violates equality and human rights.

Additionally, the NCWNZ calls for gender balance in appointments to regional planning committees and boards of inquiry to ensure diversity of knowledge and thinking. They emphasize the importance of considering the wellbeing of women and children in planning for healthier environments.

The submission is divided into two parts: a profile of NOIC and an explanation of their concerns with the Bill and suggestions for improvement.

NOIC is an irrigation scheme in North Otago that supports the production of food and fiber. They have a consent to take 8cumecs of water from the Waitaki River and distribute it to 180 farming operations. They emphasize their commitment to environmental best practices, including employing environmental staff, requiring all farms to have a Farm Environment Plan, and achieving a 94% pass rate in audits.

Their concerns with the Bill revolve around two key points: the consideration of the value of existing investment and consent duration. They argue that the value of existing investment should be considered in decisions around allocation to provide businesses with confidence and certainty for making big investment decisions. They also express concern about the proposal to truncate water consents to a maximum of 10 years, as it has significant consequences for water infrastructure businesses. They explain that consent duration is a criteria used by lenders to assess risk and the repayment terms of the facility, and many lenders will not lend for a term longer than the consent duration. They provide the example of NOIC having $84 million of debt that expires in 2030, and if they were to refinance on a 10-year term, their debt-servicing costs would increase by approximately $5 million per annum, which would not be sustainable. They argue that these arrangements will make it difficult to fund new infrastructure projects and upgrades required by schemes, including environmental upgrades. They also mention that the consent duration impacts the ability of individual farmers within their scheme to borrow money for on-farm capital projects.

The Institute raises several concerns about the proposed legislation. 

Firstly, they argue that the Climate Change Adaptation Bill should have been prioritized before the reform of the Resource Management Act (RMA) due to the urgency of addressing climate change. They also criticize the lack of analysis and review of the current system and the lack of clarity on what success looks like in the proposed legislation. 

The Institute expresses concern about the timing of the reforms, suggesting that businesses are already facing significant costs and stresses due to the pandemic and recent climate events, and adding more complexity to the system may exacerbate these challenges. They also argue that many businesses may not be well-placed to contribute to the law reform process due to consultation fatigue and other pressing matters. 

The Institute calls for consistency and alignment between the three bills and expresses concern about the lack of alignment in planning instruments and the potential for costly appeals. They also highlight the need for improved protection of places of national importance and the inclusion of the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle in the legislation. 

In their feedback on the NBE Bill, the Institute emphasizes the importance of considering the effects of climate change in resource consent applications and raises concerns about the definition of climate change, the introduction of trivial effects, and the loss of sustainable management as a key purpose. They also argue for improved protection of places of national importance and the inclusion of the precautionary principle and the polluter pays principle. 

In their feedback on the SP Bill, the Institute supports the requirement for regional spatial strategies to address the effects of climate change and the establishment of cross-regional strategies for common issues. They raise concerns about the order in which planning instruments are created and the potential for major economic events to undermine environmental outcomes.

2. Well-functioning rural and urban areas: The KCDC is concerned about the subjective and ill-defined terminology used in this clause. They suggest redrafting it to mirror the language of the NPS-UD (National Policy Statement on Urban Development) for clarity.

3. Adverse effect definition: The KCDC believes that the term ""adverse effect"" should be defined separately from ""trivial effect"" and suggests using an alternate term such as ""minor"" that has an established case law.

4. Cultural heritage definition: The KCDC is concerned that the term ""cultural heritage"" could be interpreted broadly and used to protect amenity values. They suggest defining ""cultural landscapes"" more narrowly to ensure clarity.

5. Public notice requirements: The KCDC believes that the obligation to publish public notices in newspapers is outdated and suggests providing for online and email public notifications instead.

6. Effects management framework: The KCDC is concerned about the inconsistent use of directive terms throughout the bill and suggests using the terms set out in clause 61 for greater clarity.

7. Resource allocation principles: The KCDC seeks further explanation and clarification on how the three resource allocation principles are intended to be implemented and how conflicts between them should be resolved.

8. Limits and targets: The KCDC believes that there is little information in the bill about how limits and targets will operate in practice and suggests developing them in partnership with local government to ensure practicality and achievability.

9. Compensation for esplanade reserves: The KCDC suggests combining two clauses related to compensation for esplanade reserves into a single clause for easier navigation and understanding.

It states that taking even a small amount of flood water can disrupt the balance between bedload supply and transport capacity, leading to long-term changes in the riverbed morphology. Floods also help control vegetation and weeds, and reducing flood flows can allow these to take control of the river morphology. The submission also mentions that flood harvesting can increase the deposition of fine sediment in lower-energy riverbed environments, which can have negative effects on river biota and users. Additionally, reducing flood flows can impact the ability of braided river mouths to stay open, affecting hapua ecosystems and fish migration. The submission calls for research to quantitatively predict the effects of flood harvesting on braided river geomorphology and suggests limits or mitigating conditions for such activities. Early results from the research indicate that braided rivers in Canterbury, such as the Rangitata River, are naturally vulnerable to fine sediment deposition, and flood harvesting can encourage this deposition.",person or persons,"The submission discusses the potential negative effects of flood harvesting on braided river geomorphology, including disruptions to bedload supply, increased deposition of fine sediment, and impacts on vegetation, river biota, and fish migration.",0.9745449423789978

They express their support for the need for a new resource management system and the objectives of the bill, which include protecting the natural environment, enabling development within environmental limits, and giving effect to the principles of te Tiriti o Waitangi. However, they also raise several concerns and request amendments to the bill. 

One of their main concerns is the short four-year plan making period, which they believe is unrealistic and will lead to poor planning decisions. They argue that more time is needed for community engagement, meaningful consultation with Māori, and obtaining sufficient technical input. They request an extension of the plan making period to six years.

The council also expresses concern about the lack of public participation opportunities in the bill, both in the plan making and consent processes. They argue that the limited engagement opportunities will reduce the quality of plans and request amendments to increase public participation.

Another issue raised by the council is the potential for political interference in the planning system. They believe that the bill provides opportunities for central government to make changes for political gain, which could undermine the integrity of the planning system. They request amendments to ensure that any changes are directed by an independent authority, such as the Environment Court.

The council also calls for amendments to clarify the purpose of the bill, resolve conflicting objectives, promote good urban design outcomes, and reduce the human resources required to implement the bill. They express concern about the aggressive timeline for the reform agenda and the lack of consultation with local government.

However, the council argues that several amendments are necessary to ensure the effectiveness of spatial strategies. 

The council's main arguments are as follows:

1. Reduce political interference: The council believes that the bill allows for central government political interference in spatial planning, which goes against good governance practice. They argue that the government's role should be setting national planning policy and legislation, not directing regional and district spatial planning matters. They propose that any changes should be directed by an independent authority, such as the Environment Court, to ensure decisions are based on evidence and good practice.

2. Broaden the scope of the appointing body's review: The council requests a broader scope for appointing bodies to review draft spatial strategies. They argue that the current scope, which only focuses on identifying errors and risks, limits the opportunity for appointing bodies to provide valuable feedback on the draft strategy. They propose that appointing bodies should be able to comment on opportunities, issues, local knowledge, community concerns, and other matters.

3. Recognize existing planning strategies: The council wants the bill to explicitly recognize existing district spatial strategies and the direction provided by them when considering the level of detail to be provided with regional spatial strategies. They argue that many councils have invested significant resources in developing these plans and they should not be forgotten.

4. Ensure integration with other relevant legislation: The council requests that the bill explicitly states that regional spatial strategies need to integrate with the Water Services Entities Act 2022, the Climate Change Response Act 2002, and the Climate Change Adaptation Act. They argue that land use planning needs to integrate with three waters planning and climate change adaptation planning to ensure effective and coordinated decision-making.

The council also expresses concerns about the aggressive timeline of the reform agenda and the lack of ""active listening"" by central government agencies in the process. They believe that the focus should be on good planning outcomes rather than political timeframes.",organisation,"The Kaikōura District Council supports the need for greater integration of resource management and infrastructure legislative systems but argues for amendments to the Spatial Planning Bill to reduce political interference, broaden the scope of review, recognize existing planning strategies, and ensure integration with other relevant legislation.",0.9631515741348267

The main arguments in the submission include:

1. Upholding Tiriti Settlements: The submission argues that Tiriti Settlements should have been foundational to the design of the new reforms and calls for the explicit recognition and protection of Iwi rights and entitlements under those Settlements. They also emphasize the need for adequate resourcing of Iwi to participate in the process.

2. Regional Planning Committees (RPCs): The submission argues for equal representation of central/local government and Iwi/hapū on RPCs, with an Iwi Co-Chair as a minimum expectation. They also call for the appointment of Iwi/hapū representatives by Iwi/hapū themselves and for technical expertise in local kawa, tikanga, and mātauranga on RPCs.

3. Environmental Limits and Targets: The submission calls for the inclusion of a cultural element in the determination of environmental limits and targets, specifically considering Māori cultural needs and well-being. They also highlight the importance of timeframes and the involvement of Māori in determining whether degradation of the natural environment is unacceptable.

4. Contaminated Sites: The submission raises concerns about the management of contaminated land and calls for clearer provisions regarding consultation with Māori, the classification of significantly contaminated land, and the determination of unacceptable risk to human health and the environment.

5. Compliance: The submission supports the emphasis on compliance in the bills and highlights the ability to review conditions of resource consents if breaches occur.

6. Funding for Implementation: The submission calls for adequate funding to support Iwi and hapū participation in the planning processes, including resource consenting processes, and suggests that government budgets should provide resources for this purpose.

They argue that the proposed planning regime reflects a centralization of environmental planning, which may result in the loss of local knowledge, meaningful community participation, and local decision-making. 

The council supports the concept of regional spatial strategies overseen by a Regional Planning Committee but disagrees with the need for a separate Regional Planning Committee to prepare NBE plans. They suggest that local authorities should retain the function of preparing NBE plans and that these plans should be required to give effect to regional spatial strategies. The council also recommends that the purpose of the NBE Bill be replaced with the purpose of the Resource Management Act (RMA) and that established terms and tests from the RMA be used in the new bills to ensure continuity and minimize uncertainty.

Ryman emphasizes the importance of providing quality housing and care for the aging population and believes that delays and uncertainty caused by current processes are contributing to the retirement housing crisis. The company supports initiatives in the bills that streamline planning and consenting processes but raises concerns about the time it will take to implement the new regime and the complexity and expense of the planning processes. Ryman also highlights the negative impact of the wetland protection regime in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management 2020 and Resource Management (National Environmental Standards for Freshwater) Regulations 2020 on urban development proposals. The company seeks relief as outlined in the Retirement Villages Association's submission and requests to be heard in support of their submission.,organisation,"Ryman Healthcare supports the Retirement Villages Association's submission on the Natural and Built Environment Bill and Spatial Planning Bill, emphasizing the need for streamlined planning processes to address the retirement housing crisis, while also raising concerns about implementation time and the impact of wetland protection regulations on urban development.",0.8199275135993958

FOA represents the commercial plantation forest growing industry and has expressed concerns about the proposed reforms of New Zealand's environmental legislation. 

FOA supports the policy intent to address conflicts in resource use and the shift towards consistent national and regional planning. However, they are not convinced that the new bills will better reconcile resource use and believe that there is a lack of balance between environmental protection and resource use goals. They argue that the bills may set back the goals of sustainable and integrated management.

FOA is particularly concerned about the new bottom lines and the no net effects approach in the legislation. They believe that the details regarding the effects management framework should be left to regulation and that a ""no net effects approach"" is unworkable. They also express concerns about the lack of alignment between the draft regulations and the effects management framework, as well as the lack of a cohesive approach to these issues.

The relationship with existing regulations is another area of concern for FOA. They are worried about the unclear amalgamation of existing regulations into the new legislation and the potential for further resource requirements to redevelop existing regulations. They specifically mention the Resource Management (National Environmental Standards for Plantation Forestry) Regulations 2017 and the proposed changes to the controlled and restricted discretionary classifications.

FOA also raises concerns about the management of biodiversity, the changes to consent duration, the allocation of resources, and the hearing processes. They argue that the proposed changes to existing use rights under the legislation are unclear and unnecessary, and they propose retaining the existing RMA approach to existing use rights. They also express concerns about the potential for existing land uses to have no certainty under the new legislation.

One of the main concerns raised by the council is the plan making timeframe. They argue that the prescribed four-year period for making the new combined NBE plan is too short and unrealistic, especially considering the scope and complexity of preparing the first combined plan for the Canterbury region. They suggest extending the plan making period to six years to allow for more meaningful community engagement and sufficient technical input.

The council also raises concerns about the lack of public participation opportunities provided in the bill. They argue that the limited two-year plan making period and the removal of plan making from local authorities could significantly limit public engagement. They suggest broadening the scope of engagement to include district and local issues and giving stronger weight to Statement of Community Outcomes (SCOs) to improve local government involvement and accountability.

In terms of compliance, monitoring, and enforcement, the council supports the retention and strengthening of provisions and powers outlined in the bill. However, they request clarification on the monitoring of permitted activities and the cost recovery of monitoring activities that do not involve adverse effects.

The council also raises questions and uncertainties regarding the composition and funding of regional planning committees (RPCs). They suggest that the membership of RPCs should consider not only the populations but also the land areas of individual local authorities. They also recommend that training should be required for RPC members and that the cost of training should be provided by the central government.

However, the CMF argues that several important amendments are required to ensure the bill meets its reform objectives. 

One of the key amendments requested is an extension of the plan making period from four years to six years. The CMF believes that the current timeframe is too short and will lead to poor planning decisions, inadequate community consultation, and insufficient technical input. They also argue that the short plan making period will undermine engagement with Māori and the public.

The CMF also raises concerns about the lack of public participation opportunities provided in the bill, both in the plan making and consent processes. They argue that the limited engagement opportunities will reduce the quality of plans and create discontent among those affected by development.

Another issue raised by the CMF is the potential for political interference in the planning system. They argue that the bill provides opportunities for central government to make changes for political gain, which could undermine the integrity of the planning system. They suggest that any changes should be directed by an independent authority to ensure decisions are based on evidence and good practice.

The CMF also calls for amendments to clarify the purpose of the bill, resolve conflicting objectives, promote good urban design outcomes, and reduce the human resources required to implement the bill.

They argue that any amendments made to the settlement as part of the new legislation should uphold the authority, well-being, traditions, and independence of Taranaki Whānui. They also highlight the need for informed negotiation and consensus to avoid risking the underlying relationship between Taranaki Whānui and the Crown.

2. Representation of Māori on Regional Planning Committees (RPC): PNBST believes that the proposed minimum provision for Māori representation on RPCs falls short of the principles of partnership and equality outlined in Te Tiriti o Waitangi. They argue that a 50/50 membership model between the Crown/local government and iwi/hapū is necessary to truly represent a partnership. They also criticize the convoluted and inefficient process for determining and appointing Māori representatives to RPCs.

3. Statutory Acknowledgements: PNBST supports the retention of provisions that strengthen the notification processes for iwi and hapū under the new legislation. They argue for the elevation of the legal weighting of statutory acknowledgements and for their embedding within plans, rather than being treated as mere attachments.

Overall, PNBST emphasizes the importance of upholding the durability of their settlement, ensuring equal representation for Māori on RPCs, and strengthening the notification processes for iwi and hapū.

The submission focuses on six specific concerns related to the proposed Resource Management System Reform Bills. 

One of the main arguments made by the Quarry Operators is the need for higher recognition and protection of access to aggregate resources. They argue that the current system does not prioritize the protection of these resources, leading to the sterilization of valuable resources due to other land uses. The Quarry Operators propose amendments to ensure the protection and efficient extraction of aggregate resources, including the inclusion of a definition of aggregate resources based on the Crown Minerals Act 1991.

Another argument made by the Quarry Operators is the need for regional spatial strategies to not only identify areas appropriate for developing natural resources, including aggregate resources, but also provide for their protection, necessary ancillary activities, and transport routes. They propose amending the Spatial Planning Bill to specifically provide for aggregate resources in the strategies.

The Quarry Operators also argue for the specific identification of aggregate resources within the plans and the facilitation of their use and development.

The submission raises several concerns and issues with the bills. 

Firstly, it argues that there has not been sufficient time to ensure that the reform is done right, and that the drafting of the bills has been rushed. It also states that the bills fail to meet their stated aims and lack clear direction and integration. 

The submission emphasizes the importance of Te Oranga o te Taiao as a foundational principle of the bills and calls for further work to ensure its recognition and uphold across the bills. It also criticizes the government for failing to address iwi and hapū rights and interests in freshwater and calls for equitable access to freshwater resources. 

The submission highlights the need to uphold Te Tiriti o Waitangi settlements and protect existing arrangements under the Resource Management Act. It argues for rightful recognition of the relationship of iwi and hapū with te Taiao and their resulting roles and obligations. 

The submission also raises concerns about the National Māori Entity, the resourcing of iwi and hapū to participate in the system, and the process for setting environmental limits and targets. 

In terms of specific areas of emphasis, the submission supports the retention of Te Oranga o te Taiao, the recognition of iwi and hapū planning documents, and the provisions for customary marine title and protected customary rights. It also calls for improvements in the appointment process for Regional Planning Committees and the inclusion of iwi-specific outcomes in the national planning framework.

The councils express significant concerns about the lack of integration, sequencing, and timing between the major reform areas being progressed by the government, including the Future for Local Government process and Three Waters reform. They argue that this inconsistency in direction and lack of integration is creating uncertainty and confusion for all involved with local government. 

One of the main concerns raised by the councils is the proposed Regional Planning Committees (RPCs). They argue that the RPCs will have a lot of power but lack accountability back to councils, iwi, hapū, and communities. The councils are concerned that the RPCs will make decisions on land use and infrastructure that will bind local authorities without accountability, leading to a lack of integration with decision-making on funding and financing. They also express concerns about the potential loss of representation and voice, particularly for smaller councils, and the difficulty in appointing tangata whenua onto the RPCs given the significant number of iwi and hapū groups in the region. 

The councils also raise concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the content and purpose of statements of community outcomes and regional environmental outcomes, and the need for better integration between RPCs and councils in decision-making processes. They support the strengthening of te Tiriti obligations but call for further guidance on what ""giving effect to"" the Treaty principles means in practice. They also highlight the significant cost implications for local authorities and ratepayers in funding the involvement of tangata whenua and the need for the Crown to contribute to resourcing for this.

Other concerns raised in the submission include the need for clarity on representation for territorial authorities that extend into multiple regions, recognition of local place-based plans and sub-regional plans developed under the Local Government Act, and the lack of an appropriate funding and transition plan for implementation. The councils also emphasize the need for sufficient time and resources to build capacity and capability within the workforce to implement the new system.

However, the council has concerns about certain aspects of the bills. 

STDC is concerned about the reduction of input from Territorial Authorities in the consolidation of plans into NBE plans and Regional Spatial Strategies (RSS). They are worried that this may lead to a loss of good community outcomes and system inefficiencies. 

The council also seeks further clarity on various aspects of the bills, including the role and status of the existing Resource Management Act (RMA) and planning documents during the transition to the new system, the timing of the enactment of certain clauses, and the incorporation of information from RMA planning documents into RSS. 

STDC is concerned about the loss of the ""local voice"" in the proposed planning system and the reduced role of Territorial Authorities. They believe that Territorial Authorities should have a stronger role in plan making, as they are best placed to understand the unique challenges and opportunities within their districts. The council supports the idea of elected local government representatives on Regional Planning Committees (RPCs) to provide greater accountability to the communities they represent. 

STDC also supports the strengthening of Statement of Community Outcomes (SCOs) and the inclusion of more local government input in the Independent Hearing Panel process. They believe that SCOs should carry more weight in plan making and that RPCs should be required to seek advice from affected councils on IHP recommendations. 

The council has concerns about the lack of accountability of RPCs to local authorities, the composition of RPCs, the determination of the host authority, and the funding and resourcing of RPCs and the reform process. They believe that more clarity and guidance is needed in these areas. 

STDC supports the inclusion of system outcomes in the NBE but believes that there should be a standalone urban development system outcome with more direction and clarity. They also believe that conflicts between system outcomes should be resolved in the NBE to ensure certainty. 

The council is generally supportive of regional spatial planning and the RSS process but seeks more local authority input and the inclusion of hearings in the process.

The aquaculture industry believes that reform of the Resource Management Act is long overdue and that the new bills have the potential to provide better outcomes for the industry, communities, and the environment. 

The main arguments put forward by Aquaculture New Zealand include the need for improved national direction, quality spatial planning, and centralized decision-making for key opportunities in order to realize the benefits of aquaculture. They also support the retention of aquaculture-specific provisions from the Resource Management Act and the inclusion of aquaculture as a consideration in the development of Regional Spatial Strategies. 

Aquaculture New Zealand also highlights the importance of maintaining and enhancing coastal water quality, supporting the implementation of the government's Aquaculture Strategy, and providing appropriate resourcing for land-based infrastructure. They oppose the concept of natural character and argue for a more efficient and certain consenting process for managing existing farms. 

In terms of the Spatial Planning Bill, Aquaculture New Zealand supports the integration of Regional Spatial Strategies and the inclusion of aquaculture as a consideration in the development of these strategies. They also suggest that the notification period for a draft initial Regional Spatial Strategy should be shorter than the proposed seven years.

Firstly, the TCF emphasizes the importance of the telecommunications industry as a provider of critical infrastructure, and the need for the industry to engage with the resource management system to install, maintain, and upgrade network infrastructure. They support the aims of the reforms to simplify and speed up the resource management process, but highlight the need to update existing standards for telecommunications before they are transitioned into the new National Planning Framework (NPF). They recommend extending the timeframe for the first NPF to come into force and including infrastructure providers in the engagement process.

The TCF also argues that the bills do not go far enough in ensuring that national infrastructure priorities are considered at the local level and in the plan-making process. They recommend changes to the bills to require earlier consultation with network utility operators and the communication of investment priorities through a national spatial strategy or statements of regional priorities.

Funding for infrastructure is another concern raised by the TCF. They argue that without adequate funding, the integration of infrastructure in land use development will not be achieved. They recommend requiring developers to contribute to infrastructure funding and providing more direction in the bills regarding infrastructure funding.

The TCF also raises concerns about how the system outcomes will be balanced, particularly in the event of conflicts between environmental outcomes and infrastructure outcomes. They recommend amending the infrastructure outcome to have more directive language and clarifying the role of decision-makers in managing conflicts between incompatible land uses.

Additionally, the TCF expresses concerns about the proposed permitted activity notices (PANs) and the potential for them to slow down access to telecommunications services. They recommend exempting network utility operators from the requirement to obtain a PAN or limiting PAN requirements to the NPF rather than regional plans.

The MIA represents the meat processing sector, which is New Zealand's largest manufacturing sector and a significant employer in rural communities. 

The MIA is concerned about the uncertainty introduced by the Bills, particularly as it is not clear how all three components of the new resource management system will work together. They are also concerned about the concentration and centralization of power and decision-making on resource management and planning, as well as the lack of clarity on local engagement. 

The MIA believes that the sequencing of reforms is problematic, as the National Planning Framework, which is a key component of the proposed system, is still under development and not expected to be released for consultation until after the NBEB and SPB have passed. This makes it difficult to understand how the system will work as a coherent whole. 

The MIA also raises concerns about the concepts and objectives outlined in the NBEB, stating that they are unclear and will not aid decision-making. They argue that the vague purpose statement and conflicting system outcomes will lead to more conflict and litigation. 

Another major concern for the MIA is the centralization of decision-making and implementation in the proposed system. They believe that this will be to the detriment of considering local conditions and circumstances, and that it erodes democratic principles and representation. They also express concerns about the possible tension between local economic development goals and centrally set parameters. 

The MIA is also worried about the proposed changes in the duration of resource consents, particularly for water and discharge permits. They argue that the maximum consent duration of 10 years will hamper long-term operations and investment in infrastructure and environmental improvements. They call for a more reasonable duration that allows for long-term planning and investment. 

Lastly, the MIA raises concerns about the centralization of resource allocation methods, which they believe will be driven by the National Planning Framework and/or Regional Committees.

However, the council is not convinced that the proposed bills represent the right way forward.

The council's main concerns are as follows:

They support the government's objectives for reforming the resource management system and agree that the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) is outdated and inefficient. However, they have reservations about certain aspects of the proposed changes.

The NRC highlights several problematic issues with the current resource management system, including the lack of adequate resourcing for Māori engagement, expensive and time-consuming appeals processes, difficulties in interpreting and applying national policy direction, and the allocation of water resources on a 'first in first served' basis. They argue that these issues need to be addressed in the new regime to ensure fairness and effectiveness.

They also express concerns about the strict limits regime proposed in the Bill, particularly in relation to rural communities and Māori rights and interests in ancestral lands and resources. They are also worried about the broad powers conferred on the Minister to set limits in the National Planning Framework without clear requirements for consultation and the potential impact on human rights and property interests.

They recommend a pragmatic approach to limits, similar to the structure in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management, where timebound targets are required when environmental limits are not met.

The NRC supports the inclusion of positive outcome statements in the NBA and the requirement to promote these outcomes in the National Planning Framework and plans. However, they question the practicalities of achieving environmental 'gains' in all cases and suggest focusing on restoring and enhancing the environment where limits and community aspirations are not met.

The NRC raises concerns about the lack of clarity regarding the integration of regional spatial strategies with the NBA and the role of planning committees in setting environmental limits.

They support a system that focuses on outcomes and the use of strategic spatial plans. They also support the government's commitment to Māori rights and interests in freshwater and the resolution of Treaty Settlement negotiations. However, they highlight the potential tension between Māori rights and interests, Treaty settlements, and environmental limits set nationally. They suggest that this issue needs to be resolved in the new regime and that Māori representation on joint committees may not be enough to address the tensions. 

The council provides feedback on various aspects of the reform, including the need for integrated reform of the three waters, local government, and resource management systems. They also support greater recognition of the Treaty and the role of Māori in the new system, but emphasize the need for adequate resourcing for meaningful participation. They suggest the inclusion of a national Māori entity for input into national level proposals and recommend targeted engagement with Māori on representation issues. 

The council supports the intent of the reforms and a shift to an outcomes-focused regime but suggests rationalizing the environmental outcomes in the NBA and setting priorities to reduce conflict and provide certainty. They also recommend including a ""maintain and improve"" requirement in the NBA to prevent degradation of the environment. They support retaining existing national direction and definitions as much as possible to avoid unnecessary re-litigation. 

The council strongly supports the use of regional spatial strategies (RSS) in the new system but suggests including RSS requirements in the NBA rather than a separate Strategic Planning Act. They also recommend giving more statutory weight to RSS and ensuring a robust public consultation process for their development. They emphasize the need for good representation on joint committees and the importance of implementation of RSS. 

The council supports a single combined NBA plan per region and suggests that sub-regional plans may be necessary. They support early and sustained Māori participation in the plan development process and the inclusion of private plan changes. They also raise questions about the integration of Freshwater Farm Plans with the NBA regime. 

The council suggests that the composition and structure of joint committees should be designed on a region-by-region basis and that some minimum requirements or principles should be provided.

The council believes that the RPC should be accountable to the communities they represent and that the criteria for appointing members to the IHP should be transparent.

The council supports the limitations on appeals to decisions made by the IHP and RPC, as it believes that excessive appeals undermine democracy and local choice. However, the council also expresses concerns about the usability of the Natural and Built Environment Act, suggesting that it may add more bureaucracy and complexity to the resource management process.

Overall, the council argues that the proposed legislation does not effectively address the issues with the current resource management system and calls for key amendments to be made to ensure certainty, simplicity, and local input.",organisation,"The Gore District Council has submitted a response to proposed resource management legislation, expressing concerns about the lack of clear definitions, ambiguity in existing use rights provisions, uncertainty surrounding the National Planning Framework, and the accountability and transparency of the Regional Planning Committee and Independent Hearings Panel.",0.9988471269607544

The council agrees with many of the points raised in the submission by Local Government New Zealand but highlights several specific concerns. 

One major concern is the loss of local voice in the new system. The council believes that the new provisions result in a lack of community input into the decision-making process. They argue that the new system does not adequately reflect the sense of place and characteristics of individual communities. The council suggests that the new plan should provide an opportunity for the local community to comment on the draft plan, excluding rezoning requests. They also call for a wider scope for the content of Statements of Community Outcomes and Statements of Regional Environmental Outcomes.

The council also raises concerns about the composition of the Regional Planning Committees (RPC). They believe that only elected representatives should be appointed to the RPC to ensure accountability to the community. They also argue that the RPC should be required to ""give effect to"" the Statements of Community Outcomes and Statements of Regional and Environmental Outcomes, rather than just having ""particular regard to"" them.

The council calls for greater clarity on the transitional provisions of the bill, particularly regarding the timing of the transition period and the management of resource consents during this period. They also suggest that model projects around the Regional Spatial Strategies should be advanced quickly to provide guidance for other local authorities.

In terms of systems outcomes, the council supports the inclusion of outcomes for climate change and infrastructure provision but calls for further clarification on the protection or restoration of outstanding natural features and landscapes. They also argue for greater clarity on the priorities and hierarchies of system outcomes.

The council raises concerns about the funding and administrative details of the Secretariat and the RPC. They suggest that the set-up costs of the new system should be funded at the central government level and that funding for Māori participation should also come from central government.

In terms of consenting matters, the council highlights the need for a definition of the term ""trivial effect"" and raises concerns about the potential for a precautionary approach leading to complex and time-delayed consenting. They also express concerns about the capacity of the Environment Court to handle declarations on notification decisions.

Finally, the council suggests that waste and resource recovery services should be included as a utility service and that the location of storage areas should be considered in the consent process. They also call for the consideration of resource recovery infrastructure in Regional Spatial Plans and the prioritization of waste minimization and",organisation,"The Hastings District Council has submitted its comments on the Natural and Built Environments Bill, expressing concerns about the loss of local voice, the composition of Regional Planning Committees, clarity on transitional provisions, funding and administrative details, consenting matters, and the inclusion of waste and resource recovery services.",0.9961915016174316

While they support some features of the bill, they have concerns about certain aspects. Greymouth is a New Zealand company in the upstream petroleum industry and operates in the Taranaki region. They argue that the bill should be effective, workable, and not have unintended consequences.

Greymouth highlights several themes in the bill, including the goal of delivering a simpler, faster, and cheaper resource management system. However, they argue that the bill is not simpler and may even be more complex than the current system. They also express concerns about the centralization of power and decision-making, which they believe could politicize resource management decisions and create uncertainty for system users.

Greymouth emphasizes the importance of oil and gas activities in the Taranaki region and the contribution they make to the economy and social well-being. They argue that the bill should recognize the positive effects of use and development, particularly in relation to infrastructure. They also raise concerns about the precautionary principle in the bill, stating that it is too broad and directive in its application.

In terms of existing uses, Greymouth opposes the new ""carve outs"" that could override existing use rights based on rules related to the natural environment, natural hazards, climate change, or contaminated land. They argue that this undermines investment certainty and fairness.

Greymouth supports aspects of the National Planning Framework (NPF), particularly the inclusion of direction on infrastructure. However, they believe that the mandatory NPF content clauses relating to ""enabling"" infrastructure and development corridors should be strengthened and made more directive.

Regarding environmental limits and targets, Greymouth does not oppose their use but wants to ensure that they do not inappropriately constrain use and development. They argue that the availability of exemptions should be widened, particularly for infrastructure, and not limited to Regional Planning Committees.

Overall, Greymouth supports the goals of the bill but raises concerns about its complexity, centralization of power, and potential negative impacts on investment certainty. They suggest amendments to address these concerns and ensure a more balanced approach to resource management.",organisation,"Greymouth Petroleum Ltd supports some aspects of the proposed Natural and Built Environment Bill but raises concerns about its complexity, centralization of power, and potential negative impacts on investment certainty, suggesting amendments to address these issues.",0.688683807849884

The council also raises concerns about the lack of public participation opportunities, the need for clarity in the bill's purpose and outcomes, the promotion of good urban design, and the reduction of human resources required to implement the bill. They request amendments to extend the plan making period, broaden the scope of engagement, remove the requirement for evidence with submissions, ensure inclusionary hearings panels, and trigger consent notification based on adverse effects thresholds.
